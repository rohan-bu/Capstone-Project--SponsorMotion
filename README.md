# Capstone-Project--SponsorMotion
Welcome to the SponsorMotion Data Ingestion Optimization project repository! Our goal is to optimize the data ingestion process of SponsorMotion, a consulting and data company specializing in a comprehensive database of healthcare-related events in the United States. The project focuses on improving scalability and achieving cost optimization, as well as establishing automated data quality control processes to identify problematic or duplicate records. This repository contains the necessary resources, source code, and documentation for the project. Our goal is to help streamline these processes and drive advancements in event sponsorship within the healthcare industry.
